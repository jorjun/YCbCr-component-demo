# YCbCr Component Demo

This demo is to demonstrate the transformation of an image from the RGB color space to the YCrCb color space while viewing the quality change when specify the sub sampling method (4:4:4, 4:2:2, 4:2:0). The RGB values are extracted from the original image, mapped to the YCbCr color space, separated into their own components and converted back into 3 RGB images representing Luma(Y), Chroma blue (Cb) and Chroma red (Cr). The three images are combined to created the resulting picture.
